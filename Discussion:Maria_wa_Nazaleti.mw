How to merge two pages into one (Maria wa Nazaleti and Maria ya Nazaleti)? I made some changes to  the Boklisto model mainly for '''Temple'''. Since the possessif in formal lingala for human is formed by  the agreement '''w'''-a instead of '''y'''-a, I replaced the '''y''' by '''w''' so I ended up with a non-existing page. I created a new page but after publication I realized that the page was duplicated--[[Utilisateur:Esengo|Esengo]] 15 apríli 2011 à 22:51 (UTC)Esengo
