'''Liboke ya Congo''' is a [[Red Hat|Red Hat 9]] based operating system in [[lingála]], installed using "Slinky" from The RULE-Project, and therefore running on even outdated [[esálela|PC]]s with todays speed and the most up to date applications like Abiword 2, [[OpenOffice]] 1.1, the latest Acrobat Reader or Webbrowsers like Opera 7.5 and Firefox.

"Liboke ya Congo" includes a set of Lingála-localized Applications. Most of the work of translation and research has been done by BnB-staff in [[Kinshasa]]. The "Liboke ya Congo" will help to bring IT-knowledge and better means of communication to many people in [[Kongó-Kinsásá|RKD]] and its neighbour-countries. Also it can be seen as an important step in building up a self-sustainable, localized IT-culture.
