Why are they refering to Thaksin Shinawtra as a "PRESIDENT" ???
You cannot have a King of Thailand and a President,. Presidents replace Kings. Then the Thai politics has broken international law and made a series of criminal offences.

"Suthep affirms his innocence in his statement 
A Deputy PM Suthep Thaugsuban affirms to remain innocent in his comment on the ousted PM Thaksin Shinawatra’s incentive to return to Thailand as the first president, reasoning that his statement is merely based on the former PM’s actions perceived by the public. 

During the Parliamentary session today (Februay 5), Mr. Suthep Thaugsuban, a deputy Prime Minister overseeing national security affairs, made a response to questions made by Phuea Thai Party MP regarding Mr. Suthep’s statement claiming that the ousted former PM Thaksin Shinawatra would return to Thailand and become the first president. Mr. Suthep’s statement had deeply annoyed the Phuea Thai Party members as they believed this could lead to further divergences in the nation. "

Anyway Thaksin Shinawtra has been arrest for a series of child abductions, murders,frauds,forgeries,thefts,treason, serious Human Rights Offences..
I will be coming to Government House with a Military Team soon.

The Constitution of Thailand states that to qualify as a Prime Minister you must be someone who respects or worships Almighty God through Buddha , Islaam , Christianity, Hindu or one of the religions that teach there is only one Almighty God.

Anyone involved in Satanism, Black Magic or sects that are destructive and cause torture cannot hold the position of Prime Minister, since they are not Thais or Humane. As a member of The United Nations you would be committing a serious criminal offence and would be an nemy of the human population of Thailand and The United Nations

The problems include third party mobile phone callers duplicating voice of intended receiver.

DOES THAKSIN SHINAWATRA COME FROM CATALINA IN SPAIN????? I THOUGHT MR SHINAWATRA WAS A CHINESE-THAI ?????

Did Mr Thaksin Shinawatra meet Mervyn Young in Gran Canaria in 1974 about one year after a Mervyn Young had been on a business trip to South East Asia ? 
Has Mr Thaksin Shinawatra had any dealings with the "PLYWOOD" exports of South Korea with an Alistair Dees where someone changed the contract making Mervyn Young's company the principle in the contract when the company should have been the agent.
Does Herbert Smith Solicitors in London remember this matter ??? because I think someone intentionally sabotaged the contract in an attempt to damage the success and reputation of Mervyn F S Young because they did not want him in Asia he might find out about the land they had "forged title of and defrauded" him and his beneficiaries out of ??
Isn't that the case Mr Thaksin Shinawatra?
"Erik this is Bob, I thought you new that already..." 
"I did but I couldn't remember you told me before I returned here on The Blue Ship..."
So that is why he has been trying to destroy me and our family and our friends... looks like it may be land and property and Brand frauds and murders"
"Well I did tell you to deal with that L/C first and Montague Meyer were one of the major clients"
"Bob how could I do that when I was only 13 years old at school day dreaming about girls, I thought you meant a girl called Elsie or the Sweet Shop ?"
"Bob where is my personal life? I am not at all happy with a life of being psycho-terrorised can you put the scales of justice onto it, thank you your Lordship."
My thought of compensation for damaging Mervyn Young's company and causing / arranging extreme emotional rage within people that was enough to lead to his death. I would suggest the amount would be several UK hundreds of millions of pounds. Mervyn Young's company had 23.8% of the imported chipboard market of the UK according to Dunn & Bradstreet who considered the company to be good for unlimited credit. 
I believe other failures in suppliers firms The Nobel Group division Resogil Chipboard Manufacturing Plant in Bordeaux France, there was some internal accounting issue although I do not know the outcome with some strange financial discrepancies and chipboard manufacturer Aicher Spanplaten in Austria which was financially damaged in a similar way, may be the result of sabotage from some people trying to keep Mervyn Young out of both Asia and the USA where land belonging tomy mother's family was being occupied without authority or agreement or legal title. These people we operating in business to destroy my father's reputation and finacial strength of business. It has been a massive orgie of illegal deals involving forged or aunauthorised title transfers or bond of title to holders without the knowledge of the beneficaries.
It has involved the murder of children, the abduction of friends of my children, the murder of friends of my children and the murder of Mervyn F S Young whio was a very honest man placing others before himself in the world.. PLEASE NEVER TAKE ADVICE FROM SATAN HE KILLS THE HUMAN WITHIN OUR PHYSICAL.
Erik Young (Henry-Rasmussen-Fogh-Jellinek -Kennedy-Nesbitt)

BAAROT (DRIVING PEOPLE CRAZY BUSINESS) PIRATE AND PARROT - USED VOICE TO PSYCH PEOPLE OUTLIKE TALKING CHICKENS

THE DEVIL'S OFFER (DEVELOPER) ORIGINATES FROM CATALINA WHERE LAND USED TO BUILT STRUCTURES WAS DONE WITHOUT THE "LAND LORD'S" KNOWLEDGE AND/OR AGREEMENT. SO WHO IS SATAN...NOT MERVYN F S YOUNG OR ANY OF HIS FAMILY ANDMOST OFOUR FRIENDS ARE BELIEVERS IN ALMIGHTY GOD THE LORD.
