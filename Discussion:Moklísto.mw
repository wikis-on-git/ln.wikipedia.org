To the administrator,
I  think you may redirect this page to '''Moklísto''', I did not see that it was written Mokrísto. I was reading the page about Boklísto and clicked on the word '''baklísto''' to start a new page but realized that it was in plural, I just copied and pasted and changed '''ba''' to '''mo''' without noticing that it was written bakrísto.--[[Utilisateur:Esengo|Esengo]] 8 apríli 2011 à 00:36 (UTC)Esengo
