'''Kolía mbuma eye ekokí kotɛ́lɛma mpótá ya libumu.''' I would like to know what do you mean by '''kotɛ́lɛma''' in this sentence. In lingála '''kotɛ́lɛma''' means '''to stand up''' can also mean '''to stop''' but it will depend on the context (cause something or someone to stop is '''kotɛ́lɛm-is-a'''). Someone walking and you want him to stop walking you will say '''tɛ́lɛma''' but you will not say it about a disease. This sentence is saying '''Eating this fruit may ...Hemorrhoid''', are you trying to say '''stop''', '''prevent''', '''cause''' or '''cure''' hemorrhoid. 
If you were trying to say '''stop''', it is kosílisa.<br\>
stop → kosílisa (in the context of disease) <br\>
prevent → kokébisa <br\>
cause → use kopɛ́sɛ  or komɛ́mɛ<br\>
cure → kobíkisa <br\>
