| I'm a  wikimedia steward.
|-
| Currently, I'm visiting all wikis and blocking the common spambot ips 
|-
| (the ones creating Mediawiki talk/index.php pages)
|-
| I'm not interested in inteverning in your wikis
|-
| I don't intend to overrule your decisions
|-
| I don't want to control your articles
|-
| I don't want to impose anything
|-
| '''I'm just temporary sysopping me for a few days in order to catch and block all the spambots'''
|-
| I'm also creating '''"nospam"  pages''' in order to stop those pages recreated in the future. 
|-
| If you don't want me to cleanup your wiki, leave a message and I'll remove it from my watch
