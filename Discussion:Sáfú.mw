"Normally in this community most of the farmers around don't have plums or safu in their farms, in their areas. The reasons being the safu tree will take eight or nine years before it starts giving fruit. But with the technology we have here the safu tree will start giving fruits from three to four years. It increases their income because from now if a farmer knows that if he plants a safu tree and harvests after three years equally it will help that farmer to pay his student school fees, pay hospital bills, and pay electricity bills."
