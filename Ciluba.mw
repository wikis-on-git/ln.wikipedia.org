-->

<!--
===Derived languages===

==Sounds==
Description of the sound set of the language. Can include phoneme charts and example words for each phoneme like in [[French language]]. If there is significant discussion here, it is probably best to divide the section into vowels and consonants subsections.

-->
==Vocabulary==
The [[Bantu]] word identified in [[June 2004]] by Today's Translations, a [[Britain|British]] translation company, as the most [[ilunga|untranslatable]] in the world: ''[[ilunga]]'', in the Tshiluba tongue, means "a person ready to forgive any abuse the first time, to tolerate it a second time, but never a third time". However, it is more likely to be a [[personal name]] rather than a difficult word.

<!--
==Writing system==
Brief description of the [[writing system]](s) used to write the language. Writing systems have their own page, so what's written here should just be a brief discussion of how this language makes any special use of the writing system and a link to all the writing systems used to write the language.

==Examples==
Some short examples of the language in the writing system(s) used to write the language. You might also include sound samples of the language being spoken.
