'''Pope Benedict XVI''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''Benedictus PP. XVI''; born [[April 16]], [[1927]] as '''Joseph Alois Ratzinger''' in [[Marktl am Inn]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]) is the 265th <!-- John A. Hardon's "Modern Catholic Dictionary (1980) lists Pope John Paul II as 264th pope. If you think this is inaccurate, please discuss it on the talk page before changing it here. Thanks. -->reigning [[pope]], the head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[monarch|sovereign]] of [[Vatican City]]. He was elected on [[April 19]], [[2005]], in a [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal conclave]] over which he presided in his capacity as [[Dean of the College of Cardinals|dean]] of the [[College of Cardinals]]. He celebrated his [[Papal Inauguration|Papal Inauguration Mass]] on [[April 24]], [[2005]] and was enthroned in the Basilica of St. John Lateran ([[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano]]) on [[May 7]], [[2005]].

One of the most influential academic theologians since the 1960s and author of many books, he is viewed as conservative and a close ally of his predecessor, [[Pope John Paul II]]. He served as professor at various German universities, [[Archbishop]] of [[Munich]], [[Prefect]] of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] and [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] before becoming Pope.

In response to an increasing de-christianisation in many developed countries, where [[secular humanism]], [[secularism]], and [[secularization]] are influential, the Pope particularly emphasizes what he sees as the need for Europe to turn back to its fundamental values.

==Overview==
[[Image:Benedict-salute.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Pope Benedict XVI]]
Pope Benedict XVI was [[Papal election|elected pope]] at the age of 78. He is the [[List of ages of popes|oldest person to have been elected pope]] since [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII]] in [[1730]]. He served longer as a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] before being elected pope than any pope since [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (elected [[1724]]). He is the ninth German pope, the last being the Dutch-German [[Pope Adrian VI|Adrian VI]] ([[1522]]&ndash;[[1523]]). The last pope named Benedict was [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], an Italian who reigned from [[1914]] to [[1922]], during [[World War I]].

Ratzinger was born in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. He had a distinguished career as a university [[theology|theologian]] before being made the [[archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich|Munich]]; he was subsequently made a cardinal by [[Pope Paul VI]] in the [[consistory]] of [[June 27]], [[1977]]. He was appointed as the prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in [[1981]] and was made the [[Cardinal Bishop|cardinal bishop]] of the [[suburbicarian diocese]] of [[Velletri]]-[[Segni]] on [[April 5]], [[1993]]. In [[1998]], he was made the sub-dean of the [[College of Cardinals]]; later, on [[November 30]], [[2002]], he became the dean and simultaneously the cardinal bishop of the suburbicarian diocese of [[Ostia]]. He was the first dean of the college elected pope since [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] in [[1555]] and the first cardinal bishop elected pope since [[Pope Pius VIII|Pius VIII]] in [[1829]].

Before becoming pope, Cardinal Ratzinger was already one of the most influential men in the Vatican, and was a close associate of the late John Paul II. He presided over the [[funeral of John Paul II]] and also over the Mass immediately preceding the 2005 conclave in which he was elected, in which he called on the assembled cardinals to hold fast to the doctrine of the faith. He was the public face of the church in much of the ''[[sede vacante]]'' period, although he ranked below the ''[[camerlengo]]'' in administrative authority during that time.

Benedict XVI's views appear to be similar to those of his predecessor in maintaining the traditional Catholic doctrines on artificial [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and [[homosexuality]] while promoting [[Catholic social teaching]]. 

Benedict speaks [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] fluently, and [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] slightly less fluently. He can read [[ancient Greek]] and classical [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. He is a member of a large number of academies, such as the French ''[[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]]''. He plays the [[piano]] and has a preference for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].

[[Image:PopeBenedicts1stHome.jpg|thumb|250px|Ratzinger was born at a house in Marktl am Inn which survives today.]]
[[Image:Benedict boy.jpg|thumb|250px|Ratzinger as a boy]]
[[Image:Stmichaelseminarytraunstein KerstinJoensson.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ratzinger studied at Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein, Germany.]]
Joseph Alois Ratzinger was born on [[Holy Saturday]], at Schulstrasse 11, his parents' home in [[Marktl am Inn]], [[Bavaria]]. He was the third and youngest child of [[Joseph Ratzinger, Sr.]], a police officer, and his wife, Maria Ratzinger (nee Peintner), who worked as a barmaid, and whose family were from [[South Tyrol]] (today part of [[Italy]]). His father served in both the Bavarian State Police (''[[Landespolizei]]'') and the German national Regular Police ([[Ordnungspolizei]]) before retiring in [[1937]] to the town of [[Traunstein]]. The ''[[Sunday Times]]'' of [[London]] described the elder Ratzinger as "an anti-Nazi whose attempts to rein in Hitler's [[Brown shirts|Sturmabteilung]] forced the family to move several times." {{ref|timesonline_a}}. According to the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', these relocations were directly related to Joseph Ratzinger, Sr.'s continued resistance to [[Nazism]], which resulted in demotions and transfers. {{ref|iht_demotions}} The pope's brother [[Georg Ratzinger|Georg]] said: "Our father was a bitter enemy of Nazism because he believed it was in conflict with our faith." {{ref|nytimes_faith}}.

Pope Benedict's brother, Georg, is still living. His sister, Maria Ratzinger, who never married, managed her brother Joseph's household until her death in [[1991]]. Their grand uncle [[Georg Ratzinger (politician)|Georg Ratzinger]] was a priest and member of the [[Reichstag (institution)|Reichstag]], as the German Parliament was called then. The pope's relatives agree that his ambitions to serve in the upper echelons of the Church were apparent since childhood. At age five, Ratzinger was in a group of children who presented the [[Archbishop]] of [[Munich]] with flowers; later that day he announced he wanted to be a cardinal. (See also [[Early life of Pope Benedict XVI]].)

According to his cousin Erika Kopp, Ratzinger had no desire from childhood to be anything other than a priest. When he was 15, she says, he announced that he was going to be a bishop, whereupon she playfully remarked, 'And why not Pope?'.

When Ratzinger turned 14 he was forced by law to join the [[Hitler Youth]] (membership was legally required from December [[1936]]{{ref|HistoryPlace}}.) According to the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' correspondent and biographer John Allen, Ratzinger was an unenthusiastic member who refused to attend meetings. Ratzinger has mentioned that a Nazi mathematics professor arranged reduced tuition payments for him at [[seminary]]. This normally required documentation of attendance at Hitler Youth activities; however, according to Ratzinger, his sympathetic professor arranged things so that he did not have to attend to receive a scholarship.

===Military service (1943&ndash;1945)===
In [[1943]], when he was 16, Ratzinger was drafted with many of his classmates into the [[FlaK]] ([[anti-aircraft]] [[artillery]] corps). They guarded various facilities including a [[BMW]] aircraft engine plant north of Munich and, later, the jet fighter base at [[Gilching]], where Ratzinger served in telephone communications. After his class was released from the Corps in September [[1944]], Ratzinger was put to work setting up anti-tank defences in the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] border area of [[Austria]] in preparation for the expected [[Red Army]] offensive. When his unit was released from service in November [[1944]], he went home for three weeks, and then was drafted into the German army at Munich to receive basic [[infantry]] training in the nearby town of Traunstein. His unit served at various posts around the city and was never sent to the front.

In late April or early May, 1945 days or weeks before the [[End of World War II in Europe|German surrender]], Ratzinger deserted. [[Desertion]] was widespread during the last weeks of the war, even though punishable by death (executions, frequently extrajudicial, continued to the end); diminished morale and the greatly diminished risk of prosecution from a preoccupied and disorganized German military contributed to the growing wave of soldiers looking toward self-preservation. On his way home he ran into soldiers on guard, but they let him go. When the Americans arrived in the village, all soldiers were taken [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Ratzinger was briefly interned in a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] near [[Ulm]] and was repatriated on [[June 19]], [[1945]]. The family was reunited when his brother, Georg, returned after being repatriated from a prisoner-of-war camp in Italy.

===Education (1946&ndash;1951)===
<!--

After he was repatriated in 1945, he and his brother entered Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein, and then studied at the Ducal Georgianum (''Herzogliches Georgianum'') of the [[Ludwig-Maximilian University]] in Munich. According to an interview with Peter Seewald, he and his fellow students were particularly influenced by the works of [[Gertrud von le Fort]], [[Ernst Wiechert]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Elisabeth Langgässer]], [[Theodor Steinbüchel]], [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Karl Jaspers]]. The young Ratzinger saw the last three in particular as a break with the dominance of [[Neo-Kantianism]], with the key work being Steinbüchel's ''Die Wende des Denkens'' ("The Change in Thinking"). By the end of his studies he was drawn more to the active [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] than to [[Thomas Aquinas]], and among the [[scholastic]]s he was more interested in [[Saint Bonaventure]].

On [[June 29]], [[1951]], he and his brother were ordained by [[Michael Cardinal von Faulhaber]] of [[Munich]]. His dissertation ([[1953]]) was on Saint Augustine, entitled "The People and the House of God in Augustine's Doctrine of the Church," and his ''[[Habilitation]]sschrift'' (a dissertation which serves as qualification for a professorship) was on Saint Bonaventure. It was completed in [[1957]] and he became a professor of [[Freising]] College in [[1958]].

Ratzinger became a professor at the [[University of Bonn]] in [[1959]]; his inaugural lecture was on "The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy." In [[1963]] he moved to the [[University of Münster]], where his inaugural lecture was given in a packed lecture hall, as he was already well known as a theologian.  At the [[Second Vatican Council]] ([[1962]]&ndash;[[1965]]), Ratzinger served as a ''peritus'' or theological consultant to [[Josef Cardinal Frings]] of [[Cologne]], Germany, and has continued to defend the council, including ''[[Nostra Aetate]],'' the document on respect of other religions and the declaration of the right to [[religious freedom]]. He was viewed during the time of the council as a reformer. (Later, as the [[Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church's position on other religions in the document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' ([[2000]]) which also talks about the proper way to engage in ''[[ecumenical]] dialogue''.)

In [[1966]], he took a chair in dogmatic theology at the [[University of Tübingen]], where he was a colleague of [[Hans Küng]]. In his [[1968]] book ''Introduction to Christianity'', he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and downplayed the centrality of the papacy. He also wrote that the church of the time was too centralized, rule-bound and overly controlled from Rome. These sentences, however, did not appear in later editions of the book. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of Tübingen and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] leanings of the student movement of the [[1960s]], that in Germany quickly radicalised in the years [[1967]] and [[1968]], culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (decreasing respect for authority among his students, the rise of the German [[gay rights]] movement) as related to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings. Increasingly, his views, despite his reformist bent, contrasted with those liberal ideas gaining currency in the theological academy.{{ref|nytimes_campus}} In [[1969]] he returned to Bavaria, to the University of [[Regensburg]].

In [[1972]], he founded the theological journal ''[[Communio]]'' with [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Walter Cardinal Kasper|Walter Kasper]] and others. ''Communio,'' now published in seventeen editions ([[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and many others), has become one of the most important [[journal]]s of Catholic thought. He remains one of the journal's most prolific contributors.

In March [[1977]] Ratzinger was named [[archbishop]] of [[Munich]] and [[Freising]]. According to his autobiography, ''Milestones'', he took as his episcopal motto ''Cooperatores Veritatis'', co-workers of the Truth, from [[Third Epistle of John|3 John]]: 8.

In the [[consistory]] of June 1977 he was named a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Paul VI]]. By the time of the 2005 Conclave, he was one of only 14 remaining cardinals appointed by Paul VI, and one of only three of those under the age of 80, and one of only two who participated in the conclave, the other being Cardinal Baum.

== Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (1981&ndash;2005) ==
[[Image:Cardinalratzinger C0NGR.0f faith.jpg|thumb|left|'''Cardinal Ratzinger'''. Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]

On [[November 25]], [[1981]], Pope John Paul II named Ratzinger prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], formerly known as the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition]]. He resigned the Munich [[archdiocese]] in early [[1982]]. Already a cardinal priest, he was raised to Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni in [[1993]]. He became vice-dean of the [[College of Cardinals]] in [[1998]], and dean in [[2002]]. 

In office, Ratzinger usually took traditional views on topics such as [[birth control]], [[homosexuality]], and [[Ecumenism|inter-religious dialogue]]. Among other things, he played a key role in silencing outspoken [[Liberation theology|liberation theologians]] and clergy in [[Latin America]] in the 1980s. 

(See also [[Theology of Pope Benedict XVI]].)

===Health===
In the early [[1990s]] Ratzinger suffered a [[stroke]] which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily. The existence of the stroke had been known during the conclave that elected him pope. In May 2005, the Vatican revealed that he had subsequently suffered another mild stroke - it did not reveal when, other than that it occurred between 2003 and 2005. [[France]]'s [[Philippe Cardinal Barbarin]] further revealed that since the first stroke, Ratzinger has suffered from a heart condition. Because of his health problems, Ratzinger had hoped to retire, but had continued in his position in obedience to the wishes of Pope John Paul II.{{ref|SundayTimes}}

===Response to sex abuse scandal===
As Cardinal Ratzinger was Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), the sexual abuse of minors by priests was his responsibility to investigate from 2001, when that charge was given to the CDF by Pope John Paul. {{ref|Observer-240505b_a}}

On [[May 18]], [[2001]], Ratzinger, as part of the implementation of the norms enacted and promulgated {{ref|vatican_motu}} on [[April 30]] [[2001]] by Pope John Paul II, sent a [[Latin|Latin language]] letter {{ref|vatican_2001letter}} to every bishop in the Catholic Church reminding them of the strict penalties facing those who revealed confidential details concerning enquiries into allegations against priests of certain grave ecclesiastical crimes, including [[sexual abuse]], reserved to the jurisdiction of the CDF. The letter extended the prescription ([[statute of limitations]]) for these crimes to ten years. However, when the crime is sexual abuse of a minor, the "prescription begins to run from the day on that which the minor completes the eighteenth year of age." {{ref|vatican_norms}} Lawyers acting for two alleged victims of abuse in Texas claim that by sending the letter the cardinal conspired to obstruct justice. {{ref|Observer-240505a}} However, the letter did not discourage victims from reporting the abuse itself to the police; the secrecy related to the internal investigation. "The letter said the new norms reflected the CDF's traditional “exclusive competence” regarding ''delicta graviora''&mdash;Latin for “graver offenses.” According to [[canon law]] experts in Rome, reserving cases of clerical sexual abuse of minors to the CDF is something new. In past eras, some serious crimes by priests against sexual morality, including [[pedophilia]], were handled by that congregation or its predecessor, the Holy Office, but this has not been true in recent years." {{ref|CNSb}} The promulgation of the norms by Pope John Paul II and the subsequent letter by the then Prefect of the CDF were published in 2001 in ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' {{ref|AAS}} which, in accordance with the [[Canon law|Code of Canon Law]] {{ref|CIC}}, is the [[Holy See]]'s official journal, disseminated monthly to thousands of libraries and offices around the world. {{ref|CLI}}

In [[2002]], Ratzinger accurately told the Catholic News Service that "less than one percent of priests are guilty of acts of this type." {{ref|ZE02120324}} Opponents saw this as ignoring the crimes of those who committed the abuse; others saw it as merely pointing out that this should not taint other priests who live respectable lives. {{ref|vatican_transcript}} A report by the Catholic Church itself estimated that some 4,450 of the Roman Catholic clergy who served between [[1950]] and [[2002]] have faced credible accusations of abuse. {{ref|Observer-240505b_c}} His [[Good Friday]] reflections in [[2005]] were interpreted as strongly condemning and regretting the abuse scandals, which largely put to rest the speculation of indifference. Shortly after his election, he told [[Francis Cardinal George]], the [[Archbishop of Chicago]], that he would attend to the matter. {{ref|Observer-240505b_d}}

===Dialogue with other faiths===
In [[2000]], the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published a document entitled ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' which reaffirmed the historic doctrine and mission of the Church to proclaim the Gospel. This was misunderstood by some who mistakenly believed that the Church had previously repudiated its unique role in the world. {{ref|theaustralian}}

This document pointed out the danger to the Church of ''relativistic theories which seek to justify religious pluralism'' by denying that God has revealed truth to humanity. (par. 4)

Addressing the question that one religion is as a good as another ([[syncretism]] or indifferentism) it states: ''...followers of other religions can receive divine grace, it is also certain that'' objectively speaking ''they are in a gravely deficient situation in comparison with those who, in the Church, have the fullness of the means of salvation.'' (par.22)

The deliberate omission of [[filioque clause|"filioque" clause]] ("and the Son") in the first paragraph {{ref|www.vatican.va.640}} is seen as an outreach to [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Church which has been in conflict with the [[Roman Catholic]] Church over its addition to the [[Nicene Creed]] for about one thousand years.{{ref|scoba}}

The [[World Jewish Congress]] "welcomed" his election to the pontificate, noted "his great sensitivity to the Jewish history and the Holocaust," and quoted the Pope in its press release:
:Even if the most recent, loathsome experience of the Shoah (Holocaust) was perpetrated in the name of an anti-Christian ideology, which tried to strike the Christian faith at its Abrahamic roots in the people of Israel, it cannot be denied that a certain insufficient resistance to this atrocity on the part of Christians can be explained by an inherited anti-Judaism present in the hearts of not a few Christians. {{ref|worldjewishcongress}} 

His Holiness the [[Dalai Lama]] congratulated Pope Benedict XVI upon his election. {{ref|phayul}}

In an interview in [[2004]] for ''[[Le Figaro]]'' magazine, Ratzinger said [[Turkey]], a country [[Muslim]] by heritage and staunchly [[Secularism|secularist]] by its state constitution, should seek its future in an association of [[Islamic]] nations rather than the [[EU]], which has [[Christian]] roots. He said Turkey had always been "in permanent contrast to [[Europe]]" and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake.{{ref|csmonitor}}

His defenders argue that it is to be expected that a leader within the Catholic Church would forcefully and explicitly argue in favor of the superiority of [[Catholicism]] over other religions. Others also maintain that single quotes from ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' are not indicative of intolerance or an unwillingness to engage in dialogue with other [[faith]]s, and this is clear from a reading of the entire document. They point out that Ratzinger has been very active in promoting inter-faith dialogue. Specifically, they argue that Ratzinger has been instrumental at encouraging reconciliation with [[Lutheran]]s. In defending ''Dominus Iesus'', Ratzinger himself has stated that his belief is that inter-faith dialogue should take place on the basis of equal human dignity, but that equality of human dignity should not imply that each side is equally correct.

===Ratzinger and Fatima===
[[Image:JesusMagazine.jpg|thumb|125px|Ratzinger's Article]]Ratzinger has long been tied into the message of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] to three young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] children.  Notably, until her death, [[Lúcia dos Santos]] was under orders from the Vatican not to discuss the Fatima revelations publicly unless given leave by Cardinal Ratzinger, one of seven people known to have read the actual ''Third Message'' put into writing in [[1944]], and author of the ''Theological Commentary on the Third Message'', one of four canon sourceworks kept alongside the Message.

In 1984, an interview with Ratzinger was published in the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Sisters]] newsletter and that it deals with "dangers threatening the faith and the life of the Christian and therefore of the world", while stating that it marks the beginning of the [[Apocalypse|end-times]].  A year later the interview was re-published in ''The Ratzinger Report'', though several statements were omitted &mdash; either for editorial reasons, or clandestine conspiratorial reasons, depending on the party asked.

In October 1987 he stated that "the things contained in [the] Third Secret correspond to what has been announced in Scripture and has been said again and again in many other Marian apparitions; first of all, that of Fatima in what is already known of what its message contains, conversion and penitence are the essential conditions for salvation".
 
[[Image:BertoneAndRatzinger.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ratzinger and Bertone at the press conference]]In 1997, Ratzinger and Capovilla publicly stated that the Third Message was ''not'' being withheld for fears it would condemn the changes of the [[Vatican II]] council.

On [[June 26]] [[2000]], following the release of the text of the prophecy, Ratzinger issued a joint statement with [[Cardinal Bertone]] that the third and final chapter of [[Mary]]'s prophecy had been fulfilled in 1981 in a failed attempt on the Pope's life; critics point out however that a year after the attempted assassination, Lúcia told the Pope that the third prophecy had still not been fulfilled.  He was quoted in the media as stating, "No great mystery is revealed; nor is the future unveiled. A careful reading of the text will probably prove disappointing."

== Papacy ==
[[Image:Ratzingerpascha2005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Not knowing that within a few weeks he would ascend the Throne of St. Peter himself, Ratzinger presided over the 2005 Easter Vigil Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in place of Pope John Paul II.]]
=== Election to the Papacy ===
==== Prediction ==== 
On [[January 2]], [[2005]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a frontrunner to succeed [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] should the pope die or become too ill to continue as pope. On the death of [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'' gave the odds of Ratzinger becoming pope as 7&ndash;1, the lead position, but close to his rivals on the liberal wing of the church. In [[April 2005]], before his election as pope, he was identified as one of the [[List of TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people of 2005|100 most influential people in the world]] by ''Time'' magazine. Ratzinger himself had repeatedly stated he would like to retire to a Bavarian village and dedicate himself to writing books, but more recently, he told friends he was ready to "accept any charge God placed on him."
 
Piers Paul Read wrote in ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'' on [[March 5]], [[2005]]: 
:''There can be little doubt that his courageous promotion of orthodox Catholic teaching has earned him the respect of his fellow cardinals throughout the world. He is patently holy, highly intelligent and sees clearly what is at stake. Indeed, for those who blame the decline of Catholic practice in the developed world precisely on the propensity of many European bishops to hide their heads in the sand, a pope who confronts it may be just what is required. Ratzinger is no longer young&mdash;he is 78 years old: but Angelo Roncalli, who revolutionized Catholicism by calling the Second Vatican Council was almost the same age (76) when he became pope as [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]. As Jeff Israely, the correspondent of Time, was told by a Vatican insider last month, "The Ratzinger solution is definitely on."''
   
However, Papal predictions in modern history had often been wrong, with the most popular candidates often losing the election in favor of a more unknown, obscure cardinal.

==== Election ====
[[Image:Pope Benedict XVI elected.jpg|thumb|250px|Benedict XVI appears on the balcony shortly after his election.]]

[[Image:Pope Benedict Mass of Installation.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Benedict's installation mass on St. Peter's Square]]
[[Image:Benedict sodano.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Angelo Cardinal Sodano]] kisses the ring of the new Pope for the first time at his installation mass]]

On [[April 19]], [[2005]] Cardinal Ratzinger was elected as the successor to Pope John Paul II on the second day of the [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal conclave]] after four ballots. Coincidentally, [[April 19]] is the feast of St. [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]], a German pope who instituted major reforms in the [[Middle Ages]] during his papacy. 

Cardinal Ratzinger had hoped to retire peacefully and said that "At a certain point, I prayed to God 'please don't do this to me'...Evidently, this time He didn't listen to me."  {{ref|CNNquote}}

Before his first appearance at the balcony of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] after becoming pope, he was announced by the [[Jorge Cardinal Medina Estévez]], protodeacon of the College of Cardinals. Cardinal Medina Estévez first addressed the massive crowd as "dear(est) brothers and sisters" in Italian, Spanish, French, German and English &mdash; each language receiving cheers from the international crowd &mdash; before continuing with the traditional ''[[Habemus Papam]]'' announcement in Latin. 
 
At the balcony, Benedict's first words to the crowd, before he gave the traditional ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' blessing, were: 
 
:''Dear brothers and sisters, after the great Pope John Paul II, the Cardinals have elected me, a simple and humble labourer in the vineyard of the Lord.''
:''The fact that the Lord knows how to work and to act even with inadequate instruments comforts me, and above all I entrust myself to your prayers.'' 
:''In the joy of the Risen Lord, let us move forward, confident of his unfailing help. The Lord will help us and Mary, his Most Holy Mother, will be on our side. Thank you.'' (translation from original Italian).
 
He then gave the blessing to the people.

===Choice of name===
The choice of the name Benedict (Latin "the blessed") is significant. Benedict XVI used his first [[General Audience]] in St. Peter's Square, on [[April 27]], [[2005]], to explain to the world on why he chose the name:
:''"Filled with sentiments of awe and thanksgiving, I wish to speak of why I chose the name Benedict. Firstly, I remember [[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war. In his footsteps I place my ministry in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples. Additionally, I recall [[Saint Benedict]] of Norcia, co-patron of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe. I ask him to help us all to hold firm to the centrality of Christ in our Christian life: May Christ always take first place in our thoughts and actions!" ''{{ref|vatican_FirstGenAud}}

=== Early days of Papacy ===
[[Image:Coabxvi.png|thumb|right|Papal Arms of Pope Benedict XVI. The [[papal tiara]] was replaced with a bishop's [[mitre]], and [[pallium]] of the Pope was added beneath the coat of arms.]]
Pope Benedict has confounded the expectations of many in the early days of his papacy by his gentle public persona and his promise to listen. It is notable that he has used an open [[popemobile]], saying that he wants to be closer to the people. 

[[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict's coat of arms]] have officially omitted the [[papal tiara]], traditionally appearing in the background to designate the Pope's position and replaced it with a simple [[mitre]].{{ref|coatofarms}} However, there have been papal documents since his inauguration that have been appearing with the papal tiara present. Since it is the shield and not the background which is unique to the individual Pope, various backgrounds are possible (though rarely used) for even a single shield.

During his inaugural Mass, the previous custom of all the cardinals submitting was replaced by having 12 people, representing cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple and their child, and newly [[confirmation|confirmed]] people, submit to him. However, all the cardinals had already sworn their obedience upon his election. In a return to tradition, Benedict chose to resurrect the ancient tradition of the red [[papal shoes]] and to delegate the celebration of the beatification liturgies.

===Teachings===

As Pope, Benedict XVI's main role is to teach about the Catholic faith  and the solutions to the problems of the faith, a role that he can play well being a former head of the Church's Congregation of the Faith.  The emphases of his teachings are stated in more detail in [[Theology of Pope Benedict XVI]].

====Friendship with Jesus Christ====

According to commentators, during the Inaugural Mass, the core of his message, the most moving and famous part, is found in the last paragraph of his homily where he referred to both Jesus Christ and John Paul II. After referring to John Paul II's well-known words (Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!), Benedict XVI says: 

:Are we not perhaps all afraid in some way? If we let Christ enter fully into our lives, if we open ourselves totally to him, are we not afraid that He might take something away from us?...And once again the Pope said: No! If we let Christ into our lives, we lose nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of what makes life free, beautiful and great. No! Only in this friendship do we experience beauty and liberation....When we give ourselves to him, we receive a hundredfold in return. Yes, open, open wide the doors to Christ – and you will find true life. [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20050424_inizio-pontificato_en.html]

"Friendship with Jesus Christ" is a theme of his preaching which is found in many of his homilies and his addresses. For example, his address to the priests of Rome, his diocese as bishop: [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/B16CLERO.HTM] and to the cardinals in the pre-conclave, a key public address to the Church's top leaders: [http://www.ewtn.com/pope/words/conclave_homily.asp]

===="Dictatorship of relativism"====

Continuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he has often referred to as the "central problem of our faith today": [http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZRELA.HTM] the world "moving towards a dictatorship of [[relativism]]", [http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/wyd082105.htm] on June 6, 2005 he also said: 

:"Today, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that [[relativism]] which, recognizing nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own '

He also traced the failed revolutions and ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides: "''Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism,''" he said during World Youth Day. 

In an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at [[St. John Lateran]] basilica on [[June 6]], 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]]: 
:''"The various forms of the dissolution of matrimony today, like free unions, trial marriages and going up to pseudo-matrimonies by people of the same sex, are rather expressions of an anarchic freedom that wrongly passes for true freedom of man...from here it becomes all the more clear how contrary it is to human love, to the profound vocation of man and woman, to systematically close their union to the gift of life, and even worse to suppress or tamper with the life that is born," he said.''{{ref|AP}}

===Curial appointments===
Upon becoming Pope, Benedict reappointed all former officers of the [[Roman Curia]] under John Paul II to new terms, their terms having ended with the papacy.  This assured an easy transition into new government. The highest of those appointments are those considered to be Benedict XVI's [[prime minister]]s: [[Angelo Cardinal Sodano]] of [[Italy]] who serves as [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] and [[Edmund Cardinal Szoka]] of the [[United States]] who serves as [[Governor of Vatican City]].

Benedict XVI's only major new appointment was that of his successor as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Early speculation included the names of [[Christoph Cardinal Schönborn]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna|Archbishop of Vienna]] in [[Austria]] and [[Francis Cardinal George]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Archbishop of Chicago]] in the United States. Both were renowned for their knowledge of Church doctrine and were considered among the more conservative members of the College of Cardinals.

On [[May 13]], [[2005]], Benedict XVI appointed a non-Cardinal, [[William Joseph Levada]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archbishop of San Francisco]] in the United States. Renowned for his knowledge of Church doctrine due to his office as principal editor of the current [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], Levada is considered by some to be even more staunchly conservative than all the Pope's choices within the College of Cardinals. Levada relinquishes his [[episcopal see|see]] in San Francisco on [[August 17]], [[2005]] and is expected to be raised in consistory to the title of Cardinal.

Due to the immense influence wielded by the office of Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith&mdash;arguably more immense than that of the Pope's own prime ministers&mdash;Benedict XVI's appointment of an American in effect raises the United States into greater prominence in the universal Church. That fact sparked many fears that the United States was being given too much power in the Church; people worldwide generally express uneasiness that the United States already dominates global politics. It is for that reason that Americans are never considered [[papabile]].

=== Beatifications ===
[[Image:Popebenedictxvi lei.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Benedict XVI oversaw his first beatification on May 14, 2005, honoring Mother Marianne Cope of Hawaii with the title ''Blessed''. He wore a traditional Hawaiian maile lei as a [[stole]] for the occasion.]]
On [[May 13]], [[2005]], Benedict XVI made his first promulgation of the [[beatification]] process. The honoree of the process was his predecessor, John Paul II.  Normally five years pass before the beatification process begins for a person after his or her death but due to the popularity of John Paul II &mdash; devotees chanted "Santo subito!" meaning "Saint now!" during the late pontiff's funeral &mdash; Benedict XVI waived the custom and officially styled the late pope with the title given to all those being scrutinized in the beatification process, ''[[Servant of God]]''.

Upon the confirmation after scrutiny that the late pontiff's life is found morally clean and manifests heroic virtues, a decree of heroicity will be proclaimed and John Paul II will be declared ''[[Venerable]]'' on the road to beatification. Before changes in [[canon law]] in [[1917]], the title ''Venerable'' was given at the same time a person was declared ''Servant of God''. Upon the confirmation of [[miracle]]s attributed to the honoree, John Paul II would then be declared ''[[Blessed]]''. A person is strictly prohibited from being officially celebrated in [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] until he or she achieves the title of ''Blessed''.

The next day, on [[May 14]], Benedict XVI made his first official beatification, raising [[Mother Marianne Cope]] &mdash; who served with [[Blessed Damien of Molokai]] helping those suffering from [[leprosy]] in what is now the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu|Diocese of Honolulu]] in [[Hawaii]] &mdash; to the title of "Blessed Marianne of Molokai." She was the first addition to the [[calendar of saints]] by Benedict XVI announcing an optional feast to be celebrated in her honor annually on [[January 23]]. Blessed Damien and Blessed Marianne are the [[patron saint|patrons]] of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] and [[outcast]]s.  Both are expected to become the first saints of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. [[Mother Ascensión Nicol Goñi]] was also beatified on the same day.

Unlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI delegated the beatification liturgical service to a principal aide, [[José Cardinal Saraiva Martins]], Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]. It was noted by Vatican watchers that the practice of delegating prominent functions enjoyed by the late John Paul II would become the norm for Benedict XVI, who seems to prefer the duties of Church manager as opposed to having more of a public face. This may also reflect the need for Benedict to maintain a more restricted public appearance schedule, due to his recent health history, which may be described as resulting from age related illnesses.
[[Image:Pope16mass.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pope Benedict XVI participated in a Mass attended by 800,000 people in Cologne, Germany, during the World Youth Day. This marked the pontiff's first apostolic journey.]]
On [[June 16]], [[2005]], it was learned that the planned beatification of a French priest, Fr. [[Leon Dehon]], had been suspended by the Vatican after complaints about anti-Semitism in his writings. The Vatican decided to further study the life and writings of the Fr. Dehon, who died in 1925 and who had founded the priests of the Sacred Heart of Jesus religious order. The beatification was postponed originally due to the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] on [[April 2]], [[2005]]. The move came after a French Catholic newspaper, ''La Croix'', reported that some of his writings contained anti-Semitic passages. ''La Croix'' quoted his writings as saying Jews were "united in their hatred of Jesus" and were enemies of Christians, and that anti-Semitism was a "sign of hope." 

The possibility of declaring Fr. Dehon a saint has been under consideration by the church for decades. The process began formally in 1939. The church declared his virtues in 1983, and John Paul gave him the title "venerable" in 1997 after the church ruled that an electrician in Brazil had been miraculously cured of an illness in 1954 after prayers were directed to him. However, France's government had put the Vatican on notice that it would not send a representative to the beatification, and the French bishops' conference urged the Vatican to act with caution, according to French newspaper reports. {{ref|Washington_postJune16}}.

For many in the Catholic community who had been concerned about the rapidity of the beatification process during the reign of [[Pope John Paul II]], this incident seemed to indicate that the management of the practice of making saints will be more measured and, possibly, less inclined to speed up the process.

On [[June 19]], [[2005]], Benedict XVI beatified Father [[Władysław Findysz]], a martyr of the [[Communist]] regime, Father [[Bronisław Markiewicz]], the founder of the [[Congregation of St. Michael]], and Father [[Ignacy Kłopotowski]], the founder of the [[Congregation of the Sisters of Loreto]]. Benedict XVI had delegated [[Józef Cardinal Glemp]] of [[Warsaw]] to preside over the beatification liturgy, which took place at [[Piłsudski Square]] in Warsaw. The beatifications were originally scheduled for [[April 24]] [[2005]], however they were delayed  due to the death of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Pope John Paul II also started the process of the beatifications of the above Poles, but Benedict XVI had to complete the process.

=== Canonisations ===
The first Mass of Canonisation for Benedict XVI is scheduled for [[October 23]], [[2005]] in [[St. Peter's Square]].  Benedict XVI will bestow the honour of Sainthood to: [[Józef Bilczewski]] of [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]], Archbishop of Lviv ([[Lwów]]); [[Gaetano Catanoso]] of Italy, priest and founder of the [[Congregation of the Daughters of St. Veronica]] (also known as the Missionaries of the Holy Face); [[Zygmunt Gorazdowski]] of Poland and Ukraine, priest and founder of the [[Congregation of Sisters of St. Joseph]]; [[Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga]] of [[Chile]], priest of the [[Society of Jesus]], and [[Felice Da Nicosia]] of [[Italy]], lay member of the [[Capuchins]].

=== Apostolic journeys ===
# '''Italy''' ([[May 29]], [[2005]]): Pope Benedict visited the Italian port of [[Bari]] and pledged to make the reconciliation with the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Church]] a "fundamental" commitment of his papacy. Benedict made the pledge in a city closely tied to the Orthodox Church. Bari, on Italy’s Adriatic coast, is considered a “bridge” between East and West and is home to the relics of [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas of Myra]], a 4th-century saint who is one of the most popular in both the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches. The Pope referred to Bari as a "land of meeting and dialogue" with the Orthodox Church in his homily at a Mass that closed a national religious conference. It was his first pilgrimage outside Rome since being elected the 265th leader of the Roman Catholic Church on [[April 19]].
# '''Germany''' ([[August 18]] to [[August 21]], [[2005]]): The Pope arrived in Germany on [[August 18]] in order to participate in the [[World Youth Day 2005|20th World Youth Day]] in [[Cologne]]. There he met with President [[Horst Köhler]], Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], leader of the Opposition [[Angela Merkel]] and others, and visited the famous [[Cologne Cathedral]]. The Pope visited the [[synagogue]] of the Jewish community in Cologne, which is the oldest Jewish community in the world north of the Alps. After  [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], he thus is only the third Pontiff, including [[St. Peter]], (the second in modern times) known to officially visit a synagogue. He also spoke with representatives of the Muslim and Protestant communities of Cologne. On [[August 21]] he led a mass at Marienfeld with about 800,000 youths present.
